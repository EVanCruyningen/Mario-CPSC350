# Mario-CPSC350

This is a project to create a 2D top down Mario Simulation with random event probability. Mario, the M in the text, moves around the grid and fights goombas, koopas, and bosses, and when he defeats a boss he moves to the next level. If he loses too much, he dies and the game is over.
